| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Analyze existing code for problems or invalid logic (bugs). |
| Describe common issues in JavaScript code like missing semicolons. |

## Why?

> If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Programming#Debugging" target="_blank">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a>

We are human and make mistakes. It's OK to make mistakes but in a complex computer program they are hard to track down. Becoming comfortable with debugging will make it easier to track down errors in logic.

The real world impact of bugs can be both funny and deadly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs" target="_blank">List of software bugs</a> **incomplete**

### Challenges

Challenges are primarily available as independent JSFiddle code snippets. The code in JSFiddle can be executed as if it were running on your website.

To execute a challenge on JSFiddle, click the "Run" button.

### Advanced Challenges

For advanced challenges we'll use <a href="http://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a> which we recommend using for practice. We use this site because it has a large number of different challenges created by other developers.

Many challenges are commonly seen in developer interviews.

### Create CodeWars Account

Goto <a href="http://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars.com</a> and find the link which says "JavaScript".

<a href="http://www.codewars.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1329385/10649783/b8534ed8-77fa-11e5-9d58-23c9a57361c2.png" alt="Click JavaScript to Start Challenges"></a>

They'll ask to fix at least one JavaScript challenge and submit it before creating an account.

Once you've passed all the JavaScript challenges you can connect with your GitHub. After you associate your GitHub account you are able to use CodeWars and progress on your own schedule.
